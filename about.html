      Summertime is here and I was feeling quite bored but very creative, so I am
      excited to launch my clothing company, Smoochez!
      <br />
      <br />
      ‚ú® There will be several clothing drops this summer (and hopefully beyond),
      but I have put so much effort into each piece and hope you all purchase!
      Each item is hand-stitched with fabric, ribbon, cut-outs, and more :)
      <br />
      <br />
      üõçÔ∏è I love love love the streetwear and clothes I see on Pinterest and I
      wanted to make a more unisex and affordable version, especially for college
      students - and each item has my logo and brand stitched on!
